# This example is from: Building Python Programs by Obourn, Reges and Stepp

# The program adds numbers from a file
# and reports the sum of all the numbers.
# This version skips non-numeric tokens.

def main():

    with open("bad_numbers.txt") as file:
        for n in file.read().split():
            # try to convert n to a float, but if it
            # is not a valid float, print error message
            try:
                sum += float(n)
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid number:", n)
    print("Sum is:", round(sum, 1))
